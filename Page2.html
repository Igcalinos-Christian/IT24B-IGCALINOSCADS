        <h3>My short autobiography</h3>
        <p>My name is Karan Soni. You may have seen me acting as Mr. Deadpool's taxi driver. Yes! That was me. I am a Hollywood actor and I primarily play comedic roles.</p>
        <p>I was born on the 8th of January, 1989 at New Delhiâ€”where I also lived my early childhood until studying overseas at the University of Southern California.</p>
        <p>I first appeared on screen as an actor in a comedy film,<i> Kaka Nirvana </i>, back in 2010 and since appeared in many differed shows and adverts, until I found success playing as Mr. DP's driver, Dopinder.</p>
        <p>I later was casted as the voice for 2023's <i>Spiderman: across the Spiderverse's</i> Pavitr Prabhakar, a.k.a., Spider-Man India and will be returning to DP in Dead and Wolverine this 2024.</p>
