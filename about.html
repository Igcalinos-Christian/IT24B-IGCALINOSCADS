                Hi there! My name is Krevin Hart. I'm a full on adventurer with a <b>TON</b> of experience in mystery solving and dungeon crawling.
                It only makes sense since I am what you call an... <b>"Artifact Hunter"</b>, afterall. The experiences I wanted almost never came to me
                (most of the time), so I went to them. From developing strong relationships with local merchants and magical beings to successfully leading expeditions 
                to recover over 15 <b>LEGENDARY</b> artifacts. I'm an all rounder of the all rounders. I currently reside in Hightower City. And if You're asking... Yes, there's a <b>LOT</b> of high ass towers here...
                You know where to find me. Just ask around. People know where I am all the time... which is creepy, but useful!
                
                <br><br>
