            <h1>Welcome to my about me page.</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I’m Krevin Hart, a 28-year-old freelance graphic designer based in the vibrant city of Portland, Oregon. I’m fueled by caffeine and creativity, often found sketching in cozy coffee shops or exploring the local art scene. My work blends bold colors and whimsical elements, inspired by everything from nature to vintage cartoons.

                Outside of design, I’m an avid hiker and love spending weekends in the great outdoors, capturing landscapes with my camera. I also have a soft spot for quirky thrift stores, where I hunt for unique treasures to upcycle.
                
                I’m passionate about storytelling, whether through my art or the podcasts I host, where I discuss design trends and interview fellow creatives. My goal is to inspire others to embrace their individuality and chase their dreams—after all, life’s too short for boring designs!
                
                Let’s connect and create something beautiful together!</p>
